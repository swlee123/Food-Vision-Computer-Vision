# Food-Vision-Computer-Vision

This is a Computer Vision project using tensorflow.

2/4/2023 Update : Please refer to the kaggle notebook in the link below for the best result

In this project we used the Food 101 dataset to train a model in order to differentiate 101 different foods.
We use EfficientNetB0 in this case , will update if we use other versions.
The model is trained on Google Colab notebook, some bugs may occur when running the notebook in different setting such as:

1. 100++ hours runtime
2. Tensorflow version not compatible

There will be two model in the notebook, a feature extraction model from EfficeitNetB0 and a fine-tuned version.

The version in Google Colab can't run properly due to Google Colab GPU policy, so I use kaggle to run it

Good Luck Stay Strong
